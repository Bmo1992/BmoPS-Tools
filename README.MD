This repo is full of Powershell scripts that I've written to make my daily worklife easier.
The second purpose is practicing Powershell to become more efficient. 
Note that scripts were written with VIM on a linux system as it's my preferred development platform,
when run on a Windows System the first line in each script "#!/bin/pwsh" should be removed.
