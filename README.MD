# BmoPS-Tools

BmoPS-Tools is a powershell module full of functions I've written in order to make my daily worklife easier.
The current state of the module is unfinished. 

I've organized the functions into two main directories:
    - Functions: This is where working functions tested and ready for productions reside.
    - Unfinished: This is for functions currently not ready for any number of reasons are stored.
